Hey Everyone! 
I'm Mahua Singh.
My roll no is 220101063
I'm from Computer Science and Engineering branch 
I'm from Delhi.
I love to play ukulele in my spare time.

I want to contribute to open source as it enables us to access, modify and improve upon a variety of projects. As the source code is open to all, anyone can contribute in fixing and repairing bugs which enhances the security of the entire system. The fact that everyone make use of the useful resources and can learn a great deal of new concepts intrigues me the most!
